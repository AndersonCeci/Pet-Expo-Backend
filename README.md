<h1 align="center" id="title">PET EXPO MERN APPLICATION</h1>


<p id="description">I've developed a platform specifically for pet expos, where attendees can easily register and manage their participation. Organizers have full control over event details and attendee lists. The admin user ensures centralized management, overseeing all aspects of the expo with a focus on reliability and user-friendliness.</p>
